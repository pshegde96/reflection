When would you want to use a remote repository than keep all your work local?
  There are several instances when I would want to create a remote repository. If the repository is public, other users can easily use my project.Also, by using a remote repository I can work on the same project from different computers.Also, it is easier to collaborate with others when using a remote repository.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If git automatically pulls to stay up to date with the remote repository, then we won't be able to get any work done on the local repository. As everytime I add a new commit, before pusing it to github the version on the remote repository will get pulled and the latest commit will be lost.
